Analyze the following git diff for the staged changes and generate a concise, professional commit message. The message must follow the Conventional Commits specification.

The structure should be:
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

Examples of <type>:
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Provide only the commit message, with no extra text or explanations before or after it.

Here is the git diff:
